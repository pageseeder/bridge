# PageSeeder Bridge

PageSeeder Bridge is a Java API that provides a convenient way to integrate with the **PageSeeder Service API**.

It is designed for two complementary styles of integration:

- **Low-level access** when you want precise control over HTTP calls, headers, parameters, authentication, caching/ETags, and response handling.
- **Higher-level managers** when you want common operations packaged into simple, reusable entry points (at the cost of some flexibility and visibility).

## What’s included

- A built-in HTTP client with fluent request/response handling
- Authentication support including sessions, Basic Auth, and OAuth/OpenID (for compatible PageSeeder versions)
- A basic object model (POJOs) mapping to PageSeeder concepts (members, groups, projects, folders, URIs, etc.)
- XML parsing utilities (SAX and StAX handlers) to consume API responses into objects and lists
- Convenience “manager” classes for common operations on PageSeeder objects
- Optional caching behavior (where supported/configured) to reduce repeated retrieval costs

## Package overview

- `org.pageseeder.bridge.control` — manager layer for common operations
- `org.pageseeder.bridge.http` — fluent HTTP API (requests, responses, headers, parameters, session updates, consumers)
- `org.pageseeder.bridge.model` — PageSeeder object model as simple Java POJOs
- `org.pageseeder.bridge.oauth` — OAuth/OpenID client utilities (where supported by the server)
- `org.pageseeder.bridge.xml` / `org.pageseeder.bridge.xml.stax` — SAX and StAX handlers for parsing response XML
- `org.pageseeder.bridge.nio` — PSML file type detection support

## When to use it

Use PageSeeder Bridge if you need a clean, well-structured Java integration with PageSeeder services—whether you prefer direct, explicit service calls or a more “batteries-included” manager-based approach.
